## Projects

#### Air Quality Monitoring 
> October, 2018 – till date

> Calibrating and using 19 different types of air pollution sensors with a raspberry pi computer to get the real time data of the air quality index in the various parts of a city and live feed the data to a website by using Firebase as a cloud system.

#### Real Time Attendance
> September, 2018 - November, 2018

> Using the Arduino microcontroller and RFID card reader an attendance system was made using Arduino programming, also the data uploaded to an excel sheet which collaborated with a website available to a teacher for the ease of uploading the attendance in
a particular subject.

#### Health Monitoring System 
> September, 2018 - November, 2018

> A heartbeat sensor was used alongwith the arduino and interfaced with Pi to send the data to a cloud and warn of any health issue leading to a spike or a drop in the heart rate, Also GSM module was used to send the message and location to the kin and ambulance for immediate response from their side. Another project involved uploading the data whether a driver is drunk or not by the use of a MQ3 sensor.

#### Water Quality Monitoring 
> January, 2019 – April, 2019

> Using a pH sensor, turbidity sensor for
measuring the quality of water, and uploading the data to a self created Google Firebase cloud. Attaching an app with the cloud to show the data in a real time scenario to the users. Data analysis was carried out by applying FB-Prophet algorithm upon the  time series data to predict the values of Turbidity and pH at all times of the day. Also, analytics helped to analyze when the values attain a maxima or a minima
